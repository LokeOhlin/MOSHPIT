Example program for computing the DUSTYWAVE exact solution
from Laibe & Price (2011), MNRAS xxx, xxx
http://arXiv.org/abs/1106.1736

Type "make" to compile the Fortran example code.
(you will need to have gfortran, the Gnu Fortran Compiler, installed)

run ./dustywave to generate the dustywave solutions.

The file "dustywave.mws" is a Maple worksheet that can be used to
produce the analytic expressions.
